# Signal-Generation-and-Noise-Cancellation
<p align = ”justify”>
A python script which corresponds to playing a certain melody (first few notes of the nursery rhyme "Frere Jaques") was implemented. Noise was afterwards introduced to the signal using randomly generated frequencies. The noise contaminated signal was subsequently filtered, and the original signal was successfully restored.
